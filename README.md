# Heart Failure Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model using the RandomForestClassifier algorithm to predict heart failure based on various features.

## Overview

- **Description**: This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients based on clinical features.
- **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Usage**: Use `predict.py` to make predictions with the trained model. See `src/README.md` for more details.
- **Dataset**: The project uses the Heart.csv dataset, which contains information about patients' clinical features.
- **Results**: The trained model achieved [accuracy/recall/precision] of [result].
- **Acknowledgments**: This project is based on the dataset from [source/link]. Credits to [author/contributor].
